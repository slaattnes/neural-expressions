    "The task is a test widely used and established by behavioral physiologist and pharmacologist to evaluate and compare learning and memory in rodents. It is based on the subject's aversion to an environment. The creature is programmed to evade water. The apparatus consists of a water-filled pool with a hidden escape platform beneath the surface of the water. When the creature's body enter the water, it will move around the pool to look for an escape from the water, which of the platform supply. The spatial memory is separately assessed in a probe trial without the platform. \n",
